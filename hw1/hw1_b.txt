Part b)
For values x < 0 or y < 0, while it is drawn on the coordinates, it does not display on the screen, since the bottom right corner of the window is (50,50) in our code.
OpenGL coordinates system follow a standard 2D Cartesian, but a window for display is measured physically in terms of pixels. OpenGL must be instructed how to translate specified coordinate pairs into the screen coordinates. We can do this by specifying the clipping region (space that occupies the window). In two dimensional space, the clipping region is the minimum and maximum x and y value that are inside the window. Rarely will the clipping area width and height exactly match the width and height of the window in pixels. The coordinate system must therefore be mapped from logical Cartesian coordinates to physical screen pixel coordinates. This mapping is specified by a setting known as the viewport. The viewport is the region within the windowâ€™s client area that is used for drawing the clipping area. The viewport simply maps the clipping area to a region of the window. Usually, the viewport is defined as the entire window, but this is not strictly necessary; for instance, you might want to draw only in the lower half of the window.
